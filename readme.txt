== Description ==

Fetch and display event listings managed via the RSVPMaker plugin on a remote site.

Allows the widget to be implemented independently of the full RSVPMaker plugin (which also includes it). In addition to adding a widget, you can add listings to the body of a page or post using a Gutenberg editor block.

Loads events using a JSON url such as https://rsvpmaker.com/wp-json/rsvpmaker/v1/future or https://rsvpmaker.com/wp-json/rsvpmaker/v1/type/featured

Note that this plugin will be automatically disabled if you try to activate it on a site that also includes the full version of RSVPMaker (which includes the same code).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `rsvpmaker` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
